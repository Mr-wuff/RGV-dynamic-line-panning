Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of an intelligent processing system, which consists of 8 Computer Number controllers (CNC) and 1 Rail Guide Vehicle.RGV), 1 RGV straight track, 1 feeding conveyor belt, 1 feeding conveyor belt and other ancillary equipment.The RGV is a driverless smart car that can run freely on fixed tracks.It can automatically control the direction and distance of movement according to the command, and comes with a mechanical arm, two manipulator claws and material cleaning tank, can complete the loading and unloading and cleaning materials and other tasks (see Annex 1). Figure 1: Schematic diagram of intelligent machining system For the following three specific situations: (1) The material processing operation of a process, each CNC is installed with the same tool, and the material can be processed on any CNC; (2) The material processing operation of the two processes, the first and second processes of each material are processed by two different CNC successively; (3) CNC may fail in the process of processing (according to statistics: the probability of failure is about 1%), each troubleshooting (manual processing, incomplete material scrap) time is between 10~20 minutes, immediately add to the operation sequence after troubleshooting.It is required to consider the material processing operation of one process and two processes respectively. Ask your team to complete the following two tasks: Task 1: To study the general problem and give the RGV dynamic scheduling model and the corresponding solution algorithm; Task 2: Verify the practicability of the model and the effectiveness of the algorithm by using the three groups of data of the system operation parameters in Table 1, give the scheduling strategy of RGV and the operation efficiency of the system, and fill the specific results into the EXCEL table in Annex 2.
